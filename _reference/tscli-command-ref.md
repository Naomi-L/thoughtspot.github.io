The `tscli` command line interface is an administration interface for the
ThoughtSpot instance. Use `tscli` to take snapshots (backups) of data, apply
updates, stop and start the services, and view information about the system.
This reference defines each subcommand and what you can accomplish with it.

The command returns 0 upon success and a non-zero exit code upon failure.
Because the `tscli` command is typically running a command on multiple codes, an
error may be called at different points. As much as possible, the command
attempts to save errors to the `stderr` directory as configured on a node.

## How to use the tscli command

The `tscli` command has the following syntax:

```
tscli [-h] [--helpfull] [--verbose] [--noautoconfig]
           [--autoconfig] [--yes] [--cluster <cluster>]
           [--zoo <zookeeper>] [--username username] [--identity_file identity_file]
           {access,alert,ansible, backup,backup-policy,callhome,cassandra,cluster,command,dr-mirror,etl,event,feature,fileserver,firewall,hdfs,ipsec,ldap,logs,map-tiles,monitoring,nas,node,patch,rpackage,saml,scheduled-pinboards,smtp,snapshot,snapshot-policy,sssd,ssl,storage,support,tokenauthentication}
```

The `tscli` command has several subcommands such as `alert`, `backup`, and so forth. You issue a subcommand using the following format:


```
tscli [subcommand ]
```

Subcommands have their own additional options and actions such as `tscli backup
create` or `tscli backup delete` for example.  To view help for a subcommand:

```
tscli [subcommand] -h
```

A subcommand itself may have several options.

## tscli subcommands

This section lists each subcommand and its syntax.

### access

```
tscli access [-h] {list} ...
```

Use this subcommand to do the following:

```

This subcommand has the following actions:

* `tscli fileserver configure [-h] --user` *`USER`* `[--password ` *`PASSWORD`* `]` Configures the secure file server username and password for file upload/download and the call home feature.

      which are just temporarily closed while they are being passed from one
      component to the next. (default: `4`)

    * `--force` Forces deletion of all logs and temporary files regardless of age. This must
    only be run on a stopped cluster. (default: False)

    * `--localhost_only` If used, only the logs on the localhost will be removed. If not specified, the
       command acts on the entire cluster.

* `tscli storage df [--mode disk|hdfs]`

   Checks the disk usage on the relevant mounts. Returns output similar to the Linux system command `df -h <directory>`.
