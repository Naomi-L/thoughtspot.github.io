You can always go back and view or edit a formula that was added to a search. Do this by clicking the edit icon next to its name in the **Columns** listing. Anyone who has edit privileges on an answer can also edit any formulas it contains. To view or edit an existing formula in an answer:

1. Navigate to the pinboard that contains the answer with the formula, click the **More** menu icon ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline} and select **Edit**.
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the **Columns** listing. You will see a data source called **Formulas**.
3. Expand **Formulas**, and you can see a list of all the formulas in this answer.

4. Click the edit icon ![edit icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-edit-20px.png){: .inline} next to the formula name.

5. View or edit your formula in the Formula Builder.
