The replay feature shows how to create the chart or table you are viewing. Use it to teach yourself, or take a screen recording of it and create your own ThoughtSpot training for your team.

* When viewing a chart or table, click the More icon ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline} and select **Replay search**.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/replay_search_icon.png "The Replay search icon")

    The replay will start automatically. You can pause and resume it by clicking on it.
