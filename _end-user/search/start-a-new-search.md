To start a new search:

1. From the **Home** tab, make sure that the search bar icon at the top right, next to the search bar, is set to **Search data** ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-sage-8px.png){: .inline}. ThoughtSpot remembers your choice across sessions when you switch between <strong>Search Answers</strong> and <strong>Search Data</strong>.

2. Open the **Data** panel by click the Data button, to the left of the search field.

     ![Select Data panel]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/data-panel-answer-v2.png "Select Data panel")

3. Choose your sources by clicking **Add sources**. If you already have sources in the **Data** panel, select the **Choose sources** icon ![Choose sources wrench icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-analyze-custom-10px.png "Choose sources wrench icon"){: .inline}.

    1. Filter through all available sources by using the search bar or tags.
    2. Select your sources.
    3. Select **Done**.

3. Add columns to the search bar by typing in the search bar, or by double clicking columns in the **Data** panel.

   The columns listed in the left panel are grouped together by data sources for discoverability and ease of access. You can also add multiple columns by clicking each column to select it, and then clicking **+ Add Columns**.

4. Click **Enter** on your keyboard or select **Go** to the right of the search bar. As you add items to or remove them from the search bar, press **Enter** or **Go** to ensure that ThoughtSpot updates your search.

ThoughtSpot gives your search an automatic title based on your search columns, and displays it as either a table or chart, depending on how it is best represented. You can [change the view]({{ site.baseurl }}/complex-search/change-the-view.html#) to fit your needs.
