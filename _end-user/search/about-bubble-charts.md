The bubble chart is a variation of the scatter chart, with the data points replaced with bubbles. These bubbles add a third data dimension to your answer.

The size of each bubble depends on the measure you choose under **Edit chart** ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-gear-10px.png){: .inline}.

Note that this chart type allows you to both **slice** and [slice with color]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/drag-and-drop.html#slice-with-color). The **slice** option only appears for bubble and [scatter charts]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-scatter-charts.html). It allows you to break up data based on a specific column in your data; in this case, `store type`. If you hover over a data point, you can see what store type it represents:

Your search needs at least one attribute and two measures to be represented as a bubble chart.
