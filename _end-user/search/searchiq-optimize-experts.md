We recommend that you add Experts to the datasource. These people in your organization know a great deal about the data, and can help you train SearchIQ. They are also the individuals who can assist business users in validating the answers they receive as a result of both regular Search and SearchIQ. You can learn more about that by reading about our [Ask an expert]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/ask-an-expert.html) feature.

To specify the experts for the datasource, follow these steps:

1. Click the **More** menu icon ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline} at the top right corner, and select **Manage Experts**.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manage-experts-searchiq.png "Manage Experts for SearchIQ")

2. In the **Manage Experts** window modal, you may see existing experts. Add more users and groups, and click **Add**.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/add-experts.png "Add experts")

3. After you finish adding experts, click **Done**.
