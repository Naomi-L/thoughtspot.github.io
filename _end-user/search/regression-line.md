To add a regression line, you need a search with only one attribute and one measure. Otherwise, this option is greyed out in the **settings** panel. As soon as you modify the search to contain a single measure and attribute, the regression line option is clickable.

1. While viewing your answer as a chart, click the **chart configuration** icon ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-gear-10px.png){: .inline} on the top right.

2. Click **Settings** at the bottom of the **Customize** menu.

2. Select **Regression line**.

  You can show regression lines on most types of charts (bar, stacked bar, line,
  bubble, and so on). In the following examples, `sales` is the measure and `department` is
  the attribute.
