The **Information Center** teaches new users about ThoughtSpot with a brief lesson on navigation and several quick videos on ThoughtSpot's main features.

When you sign in to ThoughtSpot, the **Information Center** appears on the lower right edge of the screen. It looks like this:

![Information center]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/information-center.png "Information center")

{: id="hide-getting-started-menu"}
## Hide the Information Center
After you go through the navigation overview and watch the short videos, you may want to hide the **Information Center**.

You can always activate the Information Center again. To show the Information Center, click the **Help** icon ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-help-10px.png "The help icon"){: .inline} and select **Show information center**.
