{: id="search"}
## Search

**Search** is where you will spend most of your time. It allows you to search and explore your data. Choose your data sources and type in the search bar at the top. As you type your search, results will appear in the main part of the screen as either a table or a chart.

If SearchIQ <span class="label label-beta">Beta</span>  <span class="label label-beta">De-support 7.0</span> is enabled by your administrator, this label is **Search+**, to differentiate it from SearchIQ. Use the search bar on the homepage to use SearchIQ.

To learn more about this section, visit [About search]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-starting-a-new-search.html#).

To learn more about SearchIQ, visit [About SearchIQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-searchiq.html#).

{: id="answers"}
## Answers

Answers are the result of a single search. You can save an answer you want to work more on later, or just keep it for your personal use. Answers are for you alone, until you share them with others.

{: id="pinboards"}
## Pinboards

Pinboards are collections of related search results. You can create your own pinboard or add to an existing one. After saving a pinboard, it can be shared with others or viewed as a slideshow. The **Pinboards** page shows a list of saved pinboards. Click one to view, edit, or share it.

To learn more about pinboards, visit [About pinboards]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/pinboards/about-pinboards.html).

## SpotIQ

If SpotIQ is enabled by your administrator, you can go here to view the status of your analysis requests to see the results.

To learn more about this section, visit [About SpotIQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/spotiq/whatisspotiq.html#).

{: id="data"}
## Data

**Data** contains a list of data sources (tables and worksheets). These are usually loaded and managed by your administrator. However, you may be able to import a spreadsheet (Excel or CSV) here, if you have the correct privileges.

To learn more about this section, visit [Working with data]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/data-view/data-intro-end-user.html#).

{: id="admin"}
## Admin

**Admin** only appears if you have administrator privileges.

This section is covered in the [ThoughtSpot Administrator Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/intro.html#).
