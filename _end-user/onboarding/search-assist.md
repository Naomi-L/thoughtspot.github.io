Search Assist walks you through simple search scenarios, using your company's data. It demonstrates how anyone can get answers to their data questions by typing in the Search bar.

For example, a Search Assist lesson might ask, ***What were sales for all products in 2019?***

Search Assist guides you to phrase this search as ***sales product 2019***.

The search then returns the Answer as a table.
