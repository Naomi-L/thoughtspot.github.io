Pinboards act like live dashboards. They are collections of your related charts, tables, and headline.

## What are Pinboards

You can pin charts and tables to any Pinboard which you created, and those that have been shared with you with the **Edit** privilege. When you create a Pinboard, you can share it with other people with either the **View** or **Edit** privilege. Pinboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.


## Create a Pinboard

To create a Pinboard:

1. Select **Pinboards**, on the top navigation bar.

2. Select **+ New Pinboard** on the Pinboards list page.

     ![Select the new Pinboard button]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/add_new_pinboard.png "Select the new Pinboard button")

3. In the **New Pinboard** dialog box, give your Pinboard a name and description. Then click **Create**.

     ![Name your Pinboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/new_pinboard.png "Name your Pinboard")

## Add an Answer to a Pinboard

You can use Pinboards to group related Answers. To add
an Answer to a Pinboard:

1. While viewing your Answer, click the **Pin** icon at the top right of the Answer.
