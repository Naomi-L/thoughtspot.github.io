ThoughtSpot sometimes deprecates existing features and replaces them with new and more effective means to use our products.  In this article, we give you advance notice of features we are discontinuing in future releases.

Please [contact](https://community.thoughtspot.com/customers/s/contactsupport) your Customer Success or SRE team for clarification.

## De-supported in 7.0

The 7.0 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for March 2021 (LA) and June 2021 (GA), dropped support for  **SearchIQ**. This feature was always in Beta, and was never deployed on production environments.

As we move to ThoughtSpot Cloud, we incorporate and further enrich the affordances of SearchIQ in Ask Answers features, and in an enhanced experience with our Home page.

## De-supported in 7.1

The 7.1 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for July 2021 (LA) and Oct 2021 (GA), will drop support for  **Instant Insights**.

As we move to ThoughtSpot Cloud, our automated insights strategy is progressively more focused and prioritized around Monitor, where users get _personalized_ insights on the metrics that are important to them.

Instant Insights currently appear in four (4) areas of our product:

- Home Page: Did you know
- Search: under the answer
- Pinboard: Pinboard Insights at the top of the pinboard
- Worksheet and Table: the Spotiq Insights tab

The current Instant Insights feature works only in on-prem deployments that use our internal database, Falcon. Embrace and cloud deployments do not support Instant Insights.  

{: id="de-support-7-2"}
## De-supported in 7.2

The 7.2 release of ThoughtSpot Software, targeted for Nov 2021 (LA), Feb 2022 (GA), will drop support for **R integration**.

Customers currently use R to generate custom charts. We plan to introduce a new feature, **Bring Your Own Charts**, for the 7.2 release.

The current integration with R works only in on-prem deployments that use our internal database, Falcon. Embrace and cloud deployments do not support Instant Insights.
