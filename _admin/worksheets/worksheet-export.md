In ThoughtSpot, you can download Worksheets to a flat file in `TSL`, [ThoughtSpot's Scripting Language]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/worksheets/yaml-worksheet.html), modify the file, and subsequently upload this file either to the same cluster, or to a different cluster.

Note that starting in release 6.2, you can use this feature to export and import Worksheets with filters.

This mechanism supports several scenarios that you may encounter:

- <strong>Migrating from a development environment to a production environment</strong> by downloading the file from the development cluster and uploading the same file into the production cluster
- <strong>Implementing metadata changes outside ThoughtSpot UI</strong>, such as replacing the underlying tables for the entire table, or replacing a single column from one table with a column in another table
- <strong>Making bulk changes</strong>, such as mass renaming of objects defined by the worksheets, and managing duplicates
- **Reusing existing objects to build new objects**, such as building two very similar objects based on a similar, pre-existing object.

## Prerequisites
