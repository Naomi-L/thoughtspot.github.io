Search Assist walks you through simple search scenarios. It demonstrates how anyone can get answers to their data questions by typing in the Search bar.

The initial example asks, ***What were sales for all products in 2019?***

Search Assist guides you to phrase this search as ***sales product 2019***.

The search then returns the Answer as a table.

The additional searches also return Answers, either in table form or as chart, to these questions:

- ***What were sales for shirts in 2019, per quarter?***;<br>The correct search here is, ***sales shirts 2019 quarterly***.

- ***What were the top-selling products during the last quarter?***;<br>The search here is, ***sales product last quarter top***.

- ***How many bags were sold per city over the last 12 months?***;<br>The search is, ***quantity purchased bags last 12 months city***.
