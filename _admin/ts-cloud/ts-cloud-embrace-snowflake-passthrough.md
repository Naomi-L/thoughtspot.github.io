Passthrough functions allow you to send SQL expressions directly to Snowflake without being interpreted by ThoughtSpot. If you have custom database functions that ThoughtSpot doesnâ€™t support, you can use these new passthrough functions in the ThoughtSpot Formula Assistant to call your custom functions.

Match the data type that the function returns with the Embrace passthrough function that returns that data type.

For example:  <TBD from Todd>

For details on all supported passthrough functions, see [Embrace passthrough functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/formula-reference.html#passthrough-functions).

For details on Snowflake SQL reference functions, see [SQL Function Reference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference-functions.html){:target="_blank"}.
