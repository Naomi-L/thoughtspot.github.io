As an analyst, you understand the power of ThoughtSpot, and you want to share this power with others. You can invite others to try ThoughtSpot out, on their own free trial cluster of ThoughtSpot Cloud. Select **Invite others** in the top right corner of the analyst home hub:

![Select invite others]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/invite-others-button.png "Select invite others")

The **Invite others** dialog box appears. Enter the email addresses of the users you would like to invite in the **email address** text box, and click the plus **+** icon to add the email address. The domains of these email addresses must be on a list of allowed domains. To add more domains to your list of allowed domains, [contact ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html).

![Add email address]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/invite-others-add.png "Add email address")

You can remove any of the email addresses by clicking the **x** that appears when you hover over an email address.

![Remove email address]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/invite-others-remove.png "Remove email address")

Add an optional message, and click **Send invite**.

![Add optional message and send invite]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/invite-others-send.png "Add optional message and send invite")

Everyone you invited receives an email with your optional message and a link to start their free trial of ThoughtSpot Cloud.
