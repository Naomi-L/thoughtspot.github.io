## Behavior of new Answer experience features
The new Answer experience is the first part of ThoughtSpot's move to a new stack. The new stack is still in progress, which has implications for the behavior of [new Answer experience features](#new-features). Some of these new features currently only work on searches and Answers, on the **Search** page and on the **Answers** page. For example, you may notice that the SpotIQ Analyze modal looks different when you analyze a data point from a Pinboard visualization rather than from an Answer or search. The following new features only work on searches and Answers:

- New SpotIQ analyze modal. On the Pinboards page, you see the old modal.
