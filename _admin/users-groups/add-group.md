a set of privileges for its users.

2. Click the **Admin** icon, on the top navigation bar.

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="20%" />
    <col width="80%" />
    </colgroup>
     <tr>
       <th>Field</th>
       <th>Description</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <th>Group name</th>
       <td>Enter a unique name for the group.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <th>Display name</th>
       <td>Name of the group as it appears in ThoughtSpot.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <th>Sharing visibility</th>
       <td>Indicate whether objects can be shared with this group. When set to <b>SHARABLE</b>,
       this group is an option in the <b>Share</b> dialog.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <th>Description</th>
       <td>Optionally enter a description.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <th>Privileges</th>
       <td><p>Check the <a href="{{"/admin/users-groups/about-users-groups.html#list-of-privileges" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">privileges</a>
       you want to grant to the group. If you add the privilege <b>Has
       administration privileges</b> to a group, all users in that group can see
       all the data in ThoughtSpot. Administrators can always see all data
       sources, and <a href="{{"/admin/data-security/about-row-security.html#" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Row level security</a> does not
       apply to them.</p>
       </td>
     </tr>
    </table>

4. Click the **Manage Groups** tab if you want to add sub-groups.

   Find the groups you want to add in the list, or search for them by name.
   Check the box next to each group you want to add to the group.

## Edit a group or delete a group

After adding a group, you can always go in and edit its settings to add or
revoke privileges. The new settings will apply to all the group members. When
editing a group, keep in mind that only sub-groups appear in a group:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/group-in-group.png)

The **No Groups in Group** only indicates there are no children in this group's
hierarchy. There may be a parent. This group inherits all the privileges of any
parent group it may have. Keep this in mind when adding users.

To edit or delete an existing group:

1. Log in to ThoughtSpot.
2. Click the **Admin** icon, on the top navigation bar.
3. In the **Admin** panel, click **User Management** and **Groups**.

4. Find the group you want to edit in the list and click its name, or the edit icon ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit_icon.png).

   If you don't see the name of the group, try searching for it. You can also delete a group from this page by clicking the **Delete** icon. Deleting a group does not delete its users.

5. Make your changes and click **Update**.

## List the group members

users are present, you must search for the specific user name.
