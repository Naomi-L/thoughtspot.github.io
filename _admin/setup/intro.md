In ThoughtSpot, both physical appliances and virtual machines ship with a base OS image. ThoughtSpot Support then helps you to install, and subsequently update the software. Note the exception of RHEL installations, where the customer provides the OS image themselves, and uses a slightly different installation protocol.

The ThoughtSpot Support team contacts all clients to schedule updates as we release new versions of ThoughtSpot. To schedule upgrades to patch releases that support your use cases, work with our Customer Success team.

As administrator, you are responsible for setting up and configuring
ThoughtSpot. This guide helps you with these tasks, and also assists in troubleshooting
some common problems and finding additional resources.
