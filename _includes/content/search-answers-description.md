You can search across all existing Answers, Pinboards, and visualizations in Pinboards that are built on Worksheets where you have access. Use this functionality if you cannot remember the exact name of a useful Answer, do not remember which Pinboard a visualization is on, or if you are simply wondering if someone else already created an Answer or Pinboard that would suit your needs.
