4. From the database, select the table you plan to sync. You can also search for the table by name.

   Note that if you use multiple tables, you have to repeat these steps for each table.

   Before confirming that you plan to sync a particular table, examine it to ensure that it has the right information: the correct data types, and reasonable sample data.

   For large tables, use the search bar to search column names.
