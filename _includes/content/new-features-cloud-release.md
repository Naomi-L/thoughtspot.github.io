The latest release of ThoughtSpot Cloud contains several new and enhanced features.

<h3>Linked Pinboard filters</h3>
You can now create one filter that filters visualizations based on multiple Worksheets by linking the Worksheet columns, at the Pinboard level. This is useful when you have a Pinboard built on multiple Worksheets, and you would like to filter on columns that are functionally the same, but exist in multiple Worksheets.<br><br>

<h3>Selective Pinboard filters</h3>
You can now configure Pinboard filters to apply to specific visualizations that you choose. This is useful when you would like to filter some, but not all, visualizations in a Pinboard.<br><br>

<h3>Enhanced data modeling capabilities</h3>
This release enables new data modeling capabilities. You can now:
<ul>
<li>Join a View to a table</li>
<li>Build a Worksheet on top of a View</li>
</ul>

<h3>Geomaps</h3>
ThoughtSpot's Geomaps now have more detailed geographic and infrastructural boundaries by default. This includes road names, cities, and so on.<br>

ThoughtSpot supports maps of many countries. See the complete list in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/reference/geomap-reference.html">Geo Map Reference</a>.

<h3>Answer V2</h3>
Answer V2 is in Beta. It is off by default in ThoughtSpot Cloud clusters. The Answer V2 feature set contains the following features:

<ul>
<li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/complex-search/how-to-add-formula.html">Improved Formula Editor</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/ts-cloud/analyst-authored-queries.html">Search Assist: Analyst authored queries</a></li>
<li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-tables.html">Table configuration</a>: conditional and number formatting for table summaries, improved conditional formatting for attributes and measures in table cells</li>
</ul>

The following features are not available in the Beta version of Answer V2. If you would like to be able to use these features, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html">contact ThoughtSpot support</a> to turn Answer V2 off for your company. You can turn it on or off individually from the <strong>Data</strong> panel on the <strong>Search</strong> page.

Answer V2 features and limitations currently only affedt searches and Answers, on the <strong>Search</strong> page and on the <strong>Answers</strong> page. For example, if you have Answer V2 on, the new version of the Formula Editor appears when you add a formula to a search, but not when you add a formula to a Worksheet. Similarly, if you have Answer V2 on, you can see existing Pivot tables in your existing Pinboards, but you cannot create new Pivot tables.
