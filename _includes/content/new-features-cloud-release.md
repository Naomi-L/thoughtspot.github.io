The latest release of ThoughtSpot Cloud contains several new and enhanced features.

<h3>Linked Pinboard filters</h3>
You can now create one filter that filters visualizations based on multiple Worksheets by linking the Worksheet columns, at the Pinboard level. This is useful when you have a Pinboard built on multiple Worksheets, and you would like to filter on columns that are functionally the same, but exist in multiple Worksheets.<br><br>

<h3>Selective Pinboard filters</h3>
You can now configure Pinboard filters to apply to specific visualizations that you choose. This is useful when you would like to filter some, but not all, visualizations in a Pinboard.<br><br>
