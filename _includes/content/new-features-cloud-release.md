The latest release of ThoughtSpot Cloud contains several new and enhanced features.

<h3>Scriptability</h3>
Scriptability contains the following new features:
<ul>
  <li>Export and update logical tables</li>
  <li>Edit, validate, and publish objects using the TSL editor</li>
  <li>Import multiple objects from the <strong>SpotApps</strong> page, or from the object list page</li>
  <li>Update Views</li>
  <li>GUID handling: a new <code>GUID</code> parameter in an object's .tsl file allows ThoughtSpot to recognize pre-existing GUIDs, and determine if you are updating an existing object, or creating a new one</li>

</ul>
