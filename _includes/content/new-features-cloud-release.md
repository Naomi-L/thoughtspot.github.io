The latest release of ThoughtSpot Cloud contains several new and enhanced features.

<h3>Scriptability</h3>
Scriptability contains the following new features:
<ul>
  <li>Export and update logical tables</li>
  <li>Edit, validate, and publish objects using the TSL editor</li>
  <li>Import multiple objects from the <strong>SpotApps</strong> page, or from the object list page</li>
  <li>Update Views</li>
  <li>GUID handling: a new <code>GUID</code> parameter in an object's .tsl file allows ThoughtSpot to recognize pre-existing GUIDs, and determine if you are updating an existing object, or creating a new one</li>

</ul>

<h3>Style Customization</h3>

<h3>In-app acceptance of ThoughtSpot's use agreement</h3>
You can now sign ThoughtSpot's end-user use agreement from the application itself. Even if you previously signed a paper copy of the use agreement, an admin must sign the agreement in the application, within 30 days of ThoughtSpot upgrading your cluster to Cloud 5.<br><br>

<h3>User adoption and performance Pinboards</h3>
This release of ThoughtSpot Cloud contains two new default Pinboards for administrators. Use the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/ts-cloud/user-adoption.html">User Adoption Pinboard</a> to understand how your ThoughtSpot users are interacting with ThoughtSpot, and how your user adoption is changing over time. Use the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/ts-cloud/performance-tracking.html">Performance Tracking Pinboard</a> to understand how your ThoughtSpot cluster is performing.<br><br>

See <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/ts-cloud/user-adoption.html">User Adoption Pinboard</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/ts-cloud/performance-tracking.html">Performance Tracking Pinboard</a>.

<h3>Linked Pinboard filters</h3>
You can now create one filter that filters visualizations based on multiple Worksheets by linking the Worksheet columns, at the Pinboard level. This is useful when you have a Pinboard built on multiple Worksheets, and you would like to filter on columns that are functionally the same, but exist in multiple Worksheets.<br><br>

Refer to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/ts-cloud/linked-filters.html">Linked Pinboard filters</a>.<br>

<h3>Selective Pinboard filters</h3>
You can now configure Pinboard filters to apply to specific visualizations that you choose. This is useful when you would like to filter some, but not all, visualizations in a Pinboard.<br><br>
