1. The filter modals for attributes and measures are different. The modal for an attribute looks like this:

    ![Attribute filter]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/filter-attribute.png "Attribute filter")

    The modal for a measure looks like this:

    ![Measure filter]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/filter-measure.png "Measure filter")

2. For an attribute filter, select values to include or exclude. You can also **select all** or **clear all**. If there are too many values, you can use the filter search bar to find the ones you want.

3. For a measure filter, select **Add a condition**. Choose an operator, such as **is greater than**, and enter a number. For example, to see underperforming stores, with sales under 10 million, select **is less than or equal to** and enter **10 million**. To add another filter for that measure, select **Add another**.

4. Select **Done**.
